            <h3> Here is a little intro about me...</h3>
            
            <p>My name is Aye Chan Thwin. I completed my undergraduate studies from UC Berkeley in 2015. With a background in molecular and cell biology, I have solidified and further expanded my knowledge and skills in this field while working in a research core at <a href="https://www.lbl.gov/" target="blank">Berkeley Lab</a>. Starting Fall 2019, I will be pursuing my master degree in chemistry at <a href="http://www.chemistry.sfsu.edu/grad_overview/0layout.php" target="blank">SFSU</a>.</p> 
            
            <p>As of now, I am building this website as a side project during my free time. The main purpose of this project is to gain an experience, which is totally different from my background. Therefore, I do not know how this website would turn out or what its contents will be, but I will figure it out along the way as I learn  basic coding languages such as html and CSS at <a href="https://www.codecademy.com" target="blank">Code Academy</a>. This is going to be a fun learning experience for me. :) </p>
