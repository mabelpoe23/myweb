        <h3> A little intro about me</h3>
		<p>My name is Aye Chan Thwin. I completed my undergraduate studies from UC Berkeley in 2015. With a background in molecular biology and cell biology, I have solidified and further expanded my knowledge and skills in this field while working in a research core.</p> 
        <p>I am currently working on a side-project--building this website--during my free time. The main purpose of this project is to gain an experience totally different from my background. I do not know how this website would turn out or what its contents will be, but I will figure it out along the way as I learn more and more. Let's see! :) </p>
